### Et Ultra's To-Do List ###
"It's like Trello but 1000x worse!"
This to-do list is structured very specifically, so if your name isn't Avery Juniper Hazel, I *highly* suggest not adding anything here.
After a large task, there is a priority marker. There are three main priority rankings: high, medium, and low. Priority rankings are declared in parentheses.
Once a task started, the person doing the task will declare their name in square brackets [like this]. Under large tasks, there may be a declaration of a pre-requisite.
This means that you must do a different task first in order to do that task. Under that, there is a short description of what must be done. This may be either a sentence or two, bullet points, or both.

### Add Tags ### (High)
Go through and add tags for each and every block.

### Set Up Worldgen ### (High)
- Set up configured features
- Set up placed features

### Add Blocks ###


### Set Up Crops ### (Low)
- Make a crop block type

### Karnis Worldgen ### (Low)
-

### Refactor ### (Low)
Go through every file you've done and clean up the code, add comments, and try to make sure a minimal amount of things is done manually rather than through datagen or code.
There are also some other things that you should look out for, such as:
- Falling block particle colors
- Map colors
- Unused or unnecessary code
